WithLag AS (
  SELECT 
    charge_group_description,

    total_arrests,
    LAG(total_arrests) OVER (
      PARTITION BY charge_group_description 
      ORDER BY arrest_year
    ) AS previous_year_arrests
  FROM ChargeYearly
),
WithChange AS (
  SELECT 
    charge_group_description,
    arrest_year,
    total_arrests,
    previous_year_arrests,
    total_arrests - previous_year_arrests AS year_over_year_change,
    ROUND(
      (1.0 * (total_arrests - previous_year_arrests)) / NULLIF(previous_year_arrests, 0) * 100, 2
    ) AS percent_change
  FROM WithLag
)
SELECT *
FROM WithChange
ORDER BY charge_group_description, arrest_year;
